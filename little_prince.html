  As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
  <underlined>
    I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.

  <highlighted>
    It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.

  In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and
  I said to myself:
  <red>
    "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."
  </red>
  As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself again:
  <red>
    "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose
    that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."
  </red>
  And I felt him to be more fragile still.
  <underlined>
    I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff
    of wind . . .
